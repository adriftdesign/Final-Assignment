Colours I can source from the website or work if not today
Fonts Helvetica, Clarendon, Arial, Palatino. Try and source from google fonts so we can make sure they are licenced. Longhand is the only script option but use sparingly.
All of this needs to be designed within the ACP Brand Guidelines.
Will need to have a good look at the layout before specifying size ect.
